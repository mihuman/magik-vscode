(Use Ctrl+Shift+P to list available commands and type 'Magik')

### **Method Search**

You can search for Magik methods using **Ctrl+T** and typing `<method name>` or `<class name>`.`<method name>`.<br>
The search supports ^ and $ for starts and ends with.<br>
e.g. `add_comp` or `map_.goto_` or `^gui_frame.^activ`<br><br>
Use **Alt+T** to refresh definitions after compiling code from the prompt, scripts or module dialog.<br>
Definitions are refreshed after using **F7**, **Ctrl+F7** etc.


### **Magik Linting**

Magik files are scanned when they are opened and saved or by using the command `Magik Check File` (**Ctrl+Shift+T**).

Warning: This does not confirm the code is without issues!

The linting can be enabled/diabled using the setting `magik-vscode.enableLinting`.

### **Magik Debugging (5.x)**

The Magik session needs to be started with a Java option to tell the JVM to load the debug agent. For example from the command line this could be:

S:\SW522\2019-10-09\core\bin\x86\runalias **-j -agentpath:S:\SW522\2019-10-09\core\bin\x86\mda.dll** -a S:\SW522\2019-10-09\cambridge_db\config\gis_aliases cambridge_db_open

To start debugging in VS Code select Debug -> Start Debugging (**F5**) and select Magik from the list.<br>
The current threads should then be listed under Call Stack in the Debug View.<br>
Toggle breakpoints by selecting a line and pressing F9 or click to the left of a line number.

I suggest using relocate_products() to ensure local source files can be found during debugging.

Limitation: Compile (saved) files rather than methods during debugging to ensure the line numbers remain in step.

Warning: There are some performance issues with stepping!

## Installation

1. Add the extension to VS Code by cloning the repo to %USERPROFILE%\\.vscode\extensions
2. Run npm install inside the Magik extension (requires Node.js to be installed):

    cd %USERPROFILE%\\.vscode\extensions\magik-vscode<br>
    npm install

3. VS Code Settings:
    * Enable `Editor: Format on Type` in the VS Code settings to allow adding _ and auto indentation.
    * Add the command `magik.gotoClipboardText` to `Terminal > Integrated: Commands To Skip Shell`.
    * Enable `Terminal > Integrated: Copy On Selection` to allow jump to source from the terminal using **F3**.

I would recommend using these other extensions:
* Bracket Pair Colorizer 2
* Git Lens
* vscode-icons

## Usage

1. Open a folder containing Magik code in VS Code (**Note: Do this before opening a terminal**).

    e.g. The magik repo or C:\projects\hg

2. Start a Magik session:

    * Option 1:
        Open a terminal in VS Code and use a runalias command
        e.g.<br>
        ```
        S:\SW522\2019-10-09\core\bin\x86\runalias -a S:\SW522\2019-10-09\cambridge_db\config\gis_aliases cambridge_db_open
        ```
        or for debugging<br>
        ```
        S:\SW522\2019-10-09\core\bin\x86\runalias -j -agentpath:S:\SW522\2019-10-09\core\bin\x86\mda.dll -a S:\SW522\2019-10-09\cambridge_db\config\gis_aliases cambridge_db_open
        ```

    * Option 2:
        Use `Magik Start Session` (**F2 z**) or `Magik Start Debug Session`
        1. Select a folder to search for aliases
        2. Select a folder to search for runalias.exe
        3. Select an alias from the list to start

    * Option 3:
        Define a list of sessions in VS Code settings and use `Magik Start Session` (**F2 z**) or `Magik Start Debug Session` to select a session from a drop-down menu.
        
        e.g. (specifying the `envBatFile` value is optional)
        ```
        "magik-vscode.sessionList": [
            {
                "label": "cambridge_db_open",
                "runAlias": "S:/SW522/2019-10-09/core/bin/x86/runalias.exe",
                "fileName": "S:/SW522/2019-10-09/cambridge_db/config/gis_aliases",
                "envBatFile": "S:/SW522/2019-10-09/cambridge_db/config/environment.bat",
                "aliasName": "cambridge_db_open"
            },
            {
                "label": "cambridge_db_open_no_auth",
                "runAlias": "S:/SW522/2019-10-09/core/bin/x86/runalias.exe",
                "fileName": "S:/SW522/2019-10-09/cambridge_db/config/gis_aliases",
                "envBatFile": "S:/SW522/2019-10-09/cambridge_db/config/environment.bat",
                "aliasName": "cambridge_db_open_no_auth"
            }
        ]
        ```


    For a Smallworld 4.x development, set the property `magik-vscode.magikProcessName`. Use the process id if running more than one session.

    ```json
    "magik-vscode.magikProcessName: "sw_magik_win32.exe"
    ```

3. Load the file vscode_dev.magik at the Magik prompt (Use shortcut **Alt+M** (when the terminal doesn't have focus)).

    This will load a set of utility procs to support navigating and compiling Magik in VS Code.
    (vscode_dev.magik is supplied in this extension)


## Tips

* VS Code Settings:
    * Increase the default terminal buffer size by adding the following:
        ```json
        "terminal.integrated.scrollback": 20000
        ```
    * Set the text encoding to iso88591:
        ```json
        "files.encoding": "iso88591"
        ```
    * Add the following commands to `Terminal > Integrated: Commands To Skip Shell`:
        * `workbench.action.showAllSymbols`
        * `workbench.action.quickOpen`
        * `magik.gotoClipboardText`
        * `magik.refreshSymbols`
        * `magik.compileExtensionMagik`

* Dev Tools:
    * Load the dev_tools_application module in a development session:
        ```
        Magik> smallworld_product.add_product("C:\projects\hg\corerepo\sw_core\modules\sw_dev_tools")
	    Magik> sw_module_manager.load_module(:dev_tools_application)
        ```
        **Note:** vscode_dev.magik should be loaded after loading the dev tools as it overrides some helper procs.
    * (Smallworld 5.x) Use relocate_products() (from the dev procs in magik_tools) to point the known products to local repositories.

        Jumping to source using F3 will then open code from the local repo.
        ```
        Magik> relocate_products()
        ```
        **Note:** Definitions should be refreshed using shortcut **Alt+T** (or vs_save_symbols()) after relocating products to update paths to source files.
* Other:
    * Load vscode_dev.magik in the .magik file in your home directory.
    * You can toggle between the editor and terminal using **Ctrl+'**
    * The module for the current Magik file can be loaded using the shortcut **Ctrl+Shift+F7**.<br>
    This will load (or reload) the module containing the file and adds products and loads prerequisite modules as necessary.<br>
    For example, this is useful for loading a test file or new module into the session.
    * You can jump to source from the terminal by selecting a method name (or class.method) and pressing **F3**. Requires the steps in 2. in the Installation notes above.
    * Use Alt+Click to move the cursor in the terminal.
    * For a light theme and Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 use these colours in the settings:
        ```
        "bracket-pair-colorizer-2.colors": [
            "333333",
            "f57c00",
            "9c27b0"
        ],
        ```
    * To add an icon for Magik files with vscode-icons add the following to the settings (adding your user name):
        ```
        "vsicons.customIconFolderPath": "C:/Users/<user_name>/.vscode/extensions/magik-vscode/icons/",
        "vsicons.associations.files": [
            { "icon": "magik", "extensions": ["magik"], "format": "png" }
        ],
        ```

## Requirements

* Requires Magik to be running in the VS Code integrated terminal (for Smallworld 5.x).
* Requires the utility procs to be loaded from vscode_dev.magik.
* VS Code must be included in your Path (e.g. 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\bin').
* Need Node.js to install in the extension dependencies.


## Extension Settings

* Enable auto indentation of Magik code (`true` by default)
    ```json
    "magik-vscode.enableAutoIndentation": true
    ```

* Enable linting of Magik code (`true` by default)
    ```json
    "magik-vscode.enableLinting": true
    ```

* Maximum amount of characters per comment line (0 = disable) (80 by default)
    ```json
    "magik-vscode.wrapCommentLineLength": 80
    ```

* Enable Magik actions in hover tooltip (Search, Go To, Run Test...).
    ```json
    "magik-vscode.enableHoverActions": true
    ```

* Enable auto scroll to the Magik prompt when sending commands to the terminal (`true` by default)
    ```json
    "magik-vscode.enableAutoScrollToPrompt": true
    ```

* Magik Debug Client URL e.g. 'localhost:4123'
    ```json
    "magik-vscode.debugClientURL": ""
    ```

* Name or ID of the process running a Smallworld 4.x session e.g. 'sw_magik_win32.exe'. Leave empty for Smallworld 5 development.
    ```json
    "magik-vscode.magikProcessName: ""
    ```

* Defines the default path to search for gis_aliases and runalias.exe to start a session.
    ```json
    "magik-vscode.smallworldHome: ""
    ```

## Known Issues

* Magik definition symbols (to support searching for methods, exemplars, conditions and globals) are only loaded automatically when compiling code using VS Code Magik commands.<br>
Use **Alt+T** to refresh definitions manually after compiling code from the prompt, scripts or module dialog.
* No highlighting or formatting at the Magik prompt - I suggest creating a temp magik file for writing Magik (**Alt+N**) and compile using **F7** or **F8**.
* Linting only available inside methods.
* No status feedback when stepping in debug session.
* The debugger can get stuck and hang the session. Sometimes pressing Pause on the thread allows you to regain control.<br>
Apologies if you need to restart your Magik session.
